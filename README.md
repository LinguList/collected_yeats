# Collected Poems of William Butler Yeats

In the [poems](https://github.com/yrgoldteeth/collected_yeats/tree/master/poems)
directory, you can find the collected poems of [WB Yeats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats) 
in markdown format.

Please submit any corrections you might find.  I found a cache of the 
collected Yeats in plaintext that had very short file names 
(looked like MS DOS limited) so I knocked together a little Ruby 
to clean them up into markdown.
